# Swap Pairs

[issue #259 of rendezvous with cassidoo](https://buttondown.email/cassidoo/archive/youve-got-to-get-up-every-morning-with-a-smile-on/).

## Description

Given a list, swap every two adjacent nodes. Something to think about: How would your code change if this were a linked list, versus an array?

## Example

```ts
> swapPairs([1,2,3,4])
> [2,1,4,3]

> swapPairs([])
> []
```
