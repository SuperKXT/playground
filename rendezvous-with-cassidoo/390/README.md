# evaluatePostfix

[issue #390 of rendezvous with cassidoo.](https://buttondown.com/cassidoo/archive/if-im-scared-be-scared-allow-it-release-it-move/)

Write a function that evaluates a postfix expression
(also known as Reverse Polish Notation) and returns the result.

The expression will contain single-digit integers and the operators +, -, \*, and /.
You can assume the input is always a valid expression!

Example:

```ts
evaluatePostfix('12+');
> 3

evaluatePostfix('56+7*');
> 77
```
