**You are given an integer n representing the total points a team wants to
score in an American football game.
You need to determine the number of unique ways the team can achieve exactly
n points using any combination of touchdowns (6 points),
field goals (3 points), or safeties (2 points).**

Example:

```ts
> waysToScore(5)
> 1

> waysToScore(12)
> 6

> waysToScore(6)
> 3
```
