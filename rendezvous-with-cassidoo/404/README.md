# addOperators

[issue #404 of rendezvous with cassidoo.](https://buttondown.com/cassidoo/archive/birds-born-in-a-cage-think-flying-is-an-illness/)

Given two integers origin and target, add operators in the origin number
to make it equal target, if possible.

You can return just one, or all possibilities for this!

Example:

```ts
> addOperators(123, 6)
> ["1*2*3", "1+2+3"]

> addOperators(3456237490, 9191)
> [] // none possible
```
