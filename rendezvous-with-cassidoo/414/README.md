# assemblyTime

[issue #413 of rendezvous with cassidoo.](https://buttondown.com/cassidoo/archive/first-we-build-the-tools-then-they-build-us/)

Youâ€™re assembling a custom mechanical keyboard. Each required part has a
delivery time in days and an assembly time in hours.

You can only assemble a part after it arrives, and you can only work on one part at a time.
Given an array of parts where each part is { name, arrivalDays, assemblyHours },
return the minimum total hours needed to finish assembling
all parts, starting from hour 0.

Example:

```ts
assemblyTime([
  { name: "keyCaps", arrivalDays: 1, assemblyHours: 2 },
  { name: "switches", arrivalDays: 2, assemblyHours: 3 },
  { name: "stabilizers", arrivalDays: 0, assemblyHours: 1 },
  { name: "PCB", arrivalDays: 1, assemblyHours: 4 },
  { name: "case", arrivalDays: 3, assemblyHours: 2 }
]);

> 74
```
