**Given a list of ingredients needed for a recipe, represented as strings,
and a list of ingredients you have in your pantry, write a function to return
the minimum number of additional ingredients you need to buy to make the recipe.**

Example:

```ts
Input: recipe = ["eggs", "flour", "sugar", "butter"];
pantry = ["sugar", "butter", "milk"];

Output: 2;
```
