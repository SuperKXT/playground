[issue #441 of rendezvous with cassidoo.](https://buttondown.com/cassidoo/archive/happiness-is-a-choice-that-requires-effort-at/)

You are given a string consisting of lowercase words,
each separated by a single space.

Determine how many vowels appear in the first word.
Then, reverse each following word that has the same vowel count.

Example:

```ts
flipWords("cat and mice");
> "cat dna mice"

flipWords("banana healthy");
> "banana healthy"
```
