# rotatedArray

[issue #329 of rendezvous with cassidoo.](https://buttondown.email/cassidoo/archive/the-best-preparation-for-tomorrow-is-doing-your-9764/)

**There is a sorted integer array that has been rotated an unknown number of times.
Given that rotated array, return how many times it has been rotated.**
It may contain duplicate numbers!

Example:

```ts
> rotatedArray([4, 0, 1, 2, 3])
> 1

> rotatedArray([7, 9, 20])
> 0

> rotatedArray([7, 7, 314, 1337, 7])
> 4
```
