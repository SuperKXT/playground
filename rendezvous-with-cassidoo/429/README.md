# knightMoves

[issue #429 of rendezvous with cassidoo.](https://buttondown.com/cassidoo/archive/your-voice-matters-your-stories-are-worth-telling/)

Given he current position of a knight as [row, col] in an 8x8 chess board represented as a 2D array,
write a function to return all valid moves the knight can make.

Extra credit: Do this for every chess piece!

Example:

```ts
knightMoves([4, 4]);
> [[2, 3], [2, 5], [3, 2], [3, 6], [5, 2], [5, 6], [6, 3], [6, 5]]

knightMoves([0, 0]);
> [[1, 2], [2, 1]]

knightMoves([1, 2]);
> [[0, 0], [0, 4], [2, 0], [2, 4], [3, 1], [3, 3]]

```
