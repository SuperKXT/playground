# longestSubsequence

[issue #388 of rendezvous with cassidoo.](https://buttondown.com/cassidoo/archive/no-problem-can-withstand-the-assault-of-sustained/)

Given a list of integers, write a function that finds the longest subsequence
where the difference between consecutive elements is either 1 or -1.

Return the length of this subsequence.

Example:

```ts
> longestSubsequence([1,2,3,4,5])
5
> longestSubsequence([4,2,3,1,5])
2
> longestSubsequence([10,11,7,8,9,12])
3
```
