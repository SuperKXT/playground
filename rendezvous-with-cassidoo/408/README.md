# isValidTrafficSequence

[issue #408 of rendezvous with cassidoo.](https://buttondown.com/cassidoo/archive/our-feelings-are-our-most-genuine-paths-to/)

Given an array of strings representing a sequence of traffic light states
("red" for stop, "green" for go, "yellow" for slow),
write a function that returns true if the sequence could represent a valid
state machine for a standard traffic light.

The only valid transitions are: red to green, green to yellow, and yellow to red.

Examples:

```ts
> isValidTrafficSequence(["red", "green", "yellow", "red", "green"]);
> true

> isValidTrafficSequence(["red", "yellow", "green"]);
> false

> isValidTrafficSequence([]);
> true
```
