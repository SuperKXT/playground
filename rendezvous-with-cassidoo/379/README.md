# maxStock

[issue #379 of rendezvous with cassidoo.](https://buttondown.com/cassidoo/archive/you-may-delay-but-time-will-not-benjamin-franklin/)

**Given an array of integers representing the stock prices of a company in chronological order, write a function that determines the maximum profit you can achieve by buying and selling the stock once.**

If no profit can be made, return 0.

Example:

```ts
> maxStock([7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4])
> 5 // (buy at 1, sell at 6)

> maxStock([7, 6, 4, 3, 1])
> 0 // (no profit possible)
```
