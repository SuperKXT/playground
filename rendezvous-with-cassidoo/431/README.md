# repeatedIntegers

[issue #431 of rendezvous with cassidoo.](https://buttondown.com/cassidoo/archive/words-once-they-are-printed-have-a-life-of-their/)

Given a positive integer n, write a function that returns an array containing all
integers from 1 to n, where each integer i appears exactly i times in the result.

For example, 3 should appear 3 times, 5 should appear 5 times, and so on.
The order of the integers in the output array does not matter.

Example:

```ts
> repeatedIntegers(4);
> [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4]
```
