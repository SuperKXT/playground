[issue #391 of rendezvous with cassidoo.](https://buttondown.com/cassidoo/archive/the-world-is-a-museum-of-other-peoples-passion/)

Given the current system of NFL uniform numbers, a given
player's position, and an array of existing numbers on
the team, write a function that returns a list of numbers
that the given player can choose from for their uniform.

Example:

```ts
> availableNumbers("QB", [1, 2, 3, 10, 19]);
> [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18]
```
